# Rationale and Research Questions
This project intends to discover whether the diet of polar bears has changed over time in Alaska. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are apex predators in the Arctic ecosystem. Polar bears depend on sea ice for hunting, typically to use a platform to hunt seals. As global temperatures rise, melting sea ice has led to habitat loss for polar bears, forcing them onto land. Without access to ice, researchers have found that polar bears enter a state of fasting, increasing the time-period during which they must rely on their fat reserves (Pilfold et al., 2016). Within this context, it is critical to understand whether the diets of polar bears are evolving, if at all, in response to climate change. This will allow researchers to predict how Polar bear populations will change based on sea ice loss predictions and whether polar bears are adapting alternative feeding strategies (e.g. terrestrial creatures) to improve survival.

We chose a USGS dataset that includes carbon and nitrogen isotope concentrations measured in polar bear hair between 1983-2017 in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Polar bears were located by helicopter and immobilized with a dart containing zolazepam-tiletamine, a common anaesthetic used in veterinary medicine. Hair was sampled by pulling 10-20 hairs from one of the upper forearms of polar bears. This dataset was chosen because elements found in hair (Nitrogen, Carbon) indicate the macronutrient composition of diets (protein vs. fat) (Rode et al., 2023).




# Dataset Information
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website, more specifically from the Alaska Science Center (ACS). It catalogues the carbon and nitrogen isotope concentrations found in polar bear hair samples in the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea. The period for obtaining these samples are as follows: Chukchi Sea samples (Russia/Alaska) were collected from periods of 1987-1989 and 2008-2017 and Beaufort Sea samples (Alaska) were collected from periods of 1983-1989 and 2004-2016. The basic data structure of this dataset is outlined below:

Column Name                   | Description
:-----------------------------|:----------------------------------
BearID                        | Unique numerical identifier for each bear   
Sex                           | The sex of the bear determined at capture
Age                           | The age of bear determined through teeth or best estimate
Capture.Date                  | The date bear was captured and hair was collected   
Year                          | The year bear was captured and sampled
Pop                           | Subpopulation boundary where bear was captured
TypicalSummerHabitat          | Whether bear summered on ice or land (only for Chukchi Sea bears)
SummerHabitatDuringHairGrowth | Whether bear summered on ice or land based on sample
Lat                           | Latitude of capture
Long                          | Longitude of capture
d15N.Air                      | Stable nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope ratios in δ notation, as parts per thousand (‰) deviation from the primary standard, atmospheric air
d13C.VPDB                     | Stable carbon (13C/12C) isotope ratios in δ notation, as parts per thousand (‰) deviation from the primary standards Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite
Percent.N                     | The percent of nitrogen by mass measured in the hair
Percent.C                     | The percent carbon by mass measured in the hair

# Data Wrangling
Data was wrangled first by taking out two unnecessary columns: “TypicalSummerHabitat” and “SummerHabitatDuringHairGrowth”. These columns only had data for about half of the recorded hair samples and weren’t deemed necessary to undergo further data analysis. After they were taken out, all other samples with “NA” fields were taken out of the cleaned dataset.
