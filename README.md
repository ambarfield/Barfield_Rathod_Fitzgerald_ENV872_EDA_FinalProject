# Barfield_Rathod_Fitzgerald_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject
1. ENV 872 Course Project for A. Barfield, P. Rathod, and K. Fitzgerald

2. Course Project: This project fulfills the requirements for the final project of ENV872: Environmental Data Exploration at Duke University in Fall 2024. The requirements of the project are to perform different forms of analysis that have been learned throughout the course on a dataset of your own choosing. The final output should be a visually pleasing version of this analysis without code. 

3. Project Topic: This project is titled: Analysis of Polar Bear Diets in the Chukchi & Beaufort Sea. Using a dataset obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website (more specifically from the Alaska Science Center), we performed various forms of data anlysis on a dataset cataloguing the carbon and nitrogen isotope concentrations found in polar bear hair samples in the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea. The period for obtaining these samples are as follows: Chukchi Sea samples (Russia/Alaska) were collected from periods of 1987-1989 and 2008-2017 and Beaufort Sea samples (Alaska) were collected from periods of 1983-1989 and 2004-2016. This information is important because it could give researchers insight into whether the diet of polar bears has changed over time in Alaska. sotope concentrations also indicate whether the polar bears rely on terrestrial vs. marine prey and if this has changed over time.
